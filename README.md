## Inspiration

I have always loved building projects and apps that enhance people's lives and help solve a major problem in our world. Harassment is a major issue in our world and it's hard to find a safe and easy way to get instant help if you are being or have been harassed.  I was really inspired by the Hack Harassment website and the mission to give everyone a voice to stand up to harassment. It's a topic that I am really passionate about trying to find a fix for and I decided I wanted to create a social good hack at NwHacks 2017

## What it does

StandFree Bee is a facebook messenger bot and platform that guides you through the steps into reporting incidents of harassment in cities around North America. The bot gives suggestions on what to do in certain situations and will also provide links to instant help lines and other resources an individual may need. They also are able to send reports through an online form that will be customized for each city in order for the report to be sent to the right organization that can provide help on what to do in situations of harassment

## How I built it

StandFree Bee was built with Api.ai using JSON data for the message requests. The website was built with HTML, CSS, MaterialCSS and PHP for the backend.

## Challenges I ran into
Some challenges I ran into was creating an engaging experience in where the user would be able to get the right answer they need from their request and make sure that they were always given the right answer back.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This is one of the first bots I have worked on for the facebook messenger platform and I am really proud to have created a bot that truly can create a difference in our world and stand up to harassment.

## What I learned

I learned a lot about how facebook messenger bots work and what services you can use to enhance and train your bot to learn and get smarter over a period of time.

## The name
The name StandFree Bee meaning is about standing up and being free from harassment. The name may change in the future. 

## What's next for StandFree Bee

I would love to publish this bot and make it accessible to all messenger users. I also would like to find a way to improve the AI and keep expanding on what StandFree Bee can do.
